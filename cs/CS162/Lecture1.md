Does the programmer need to write a single program that performs many independent activites?   
Does every program have to be altered for every piece of hardware?   
Does a faulty program crash everything?   
Does every program have access to all hardware?   
: Hopefully, no!

Operating Systems:
- Provide convenient abstractions to handle diverse hardware
(Convenience, protection, reliablity obtanied in creating the illusion)
- Coordinate resources and protect users from each other
(Using a few critical hardware mechanisms)
- Simplify application development by providing standard services
- Provide fault containment, fault tolerance, and fault recovery
