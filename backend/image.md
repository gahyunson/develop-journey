Running Django in development mode vs Running Django in the production mode
- Mapping


1. Handling, Uploading and managing static and media files.
2. Adding image dependencies
3. Updating model with image field
4. Adding image endpoint

1. Dockerfile
```dockerfile
RUN python -m venv /py && \
    ...
    apk add --update --no-cache postgresql-client jpeg-dev && \
    ...
        build-base postgresql-dev musl-dev zlib zlib-dev && \
```
`jpeg-dev` needs to run Pillows.
Above an apk line code means dependencies that are going to remain on the docker image.

`zlib zlib-dev` will install requirements. and then we're going to remove them later on in the build steps.

2. requirements.txt
`Pillow>=8.2.0,<8.3.0`
